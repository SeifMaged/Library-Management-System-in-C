# Library-Management-System-in-C
A library management system that allows the user to add, delete, modify, save, search, and print books in multiple sorted arrangements.
This program first asks the user to login with a username and password that are stored in the "credentials.txt" text file.
After logging in, the user may choose from an assortment of different functions that will verify each input from the user and proceed accordingly.

Note that this is a group project and my first major project in programming so it is in no way as efficient as I would like it to be.
